    "\n",
    "Polymer dielectrics have many applications such as in organic photovoltaics and wearable electronics.  One property that a polymer should have as a dielectric is a high bandgap energy.  There are two compounding difficulties in searching for polymer candidates for these technologies: the volume of chemical space is vast and the evaluation of material properties via *ab initio* methods are computationally expensive.  However it is possible to build a model to  predict the properties of polymers using regression, a supervised learning method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we will perform regression on the bandgap energy of certain polymers.  The data is located in `polymers.csv`.  Featured are 284 unique 4-block materials composed of 7 different molecular building blocks: $CH_2$, $NH$, $CO$, $C_6 H_4$, $C_4 H_2 S$, $CS$, and $O$.  The polymers are understood to repeat indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of how data is represented is an important part of machine learning.  One such representation of our molecule data is the $M_{II}$ fingerprint, which is a normalized count of the number of different types of pairs of building blocks in a polyer.  The representation is therefore a $7 \\times 7$ matrix with these specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sum of all elements in the matrix should be equal to 4 (since we are dealing with 4-block materials) $$ \\sum^7_{i,j} M_{ij} = 4$$\n",
    "2. The sum of elemnents in any row or column of $M$ should be equal to the total number of blocks of that kind in the polymer.\n",
    "3. The period symmetry in the polymer dictates that $M$ is a symmetric matrix.  In other words, polymers have the same bandgap energy if they are mirrored.\n",
    "4. The diagonal elements of $M$ are integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform the data from `polymers.csv` so that each molecule is represented in the $M_{II}$ fingerprint."
